such as       

1. First **be sure that you fully understand the systems and tools you are working with**

2. Second ***A good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that itâ€™s really easy to shake out all the bugs***
    

3. Third ***Always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required and there is a need to implement them. Because unnecessary changes will increase defects in your software***
